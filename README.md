The need for effective parking systems has
grown critical given the worldwide growth in automobile
ownership. A potential solution has developed for real-time
unoccupied parking space detection: smart parking systems
that make use of AI algorithms. This study compares the
performance of the most recent, cutting-edge object detection
model, YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 8, with YOLO
version 7, and analyzes potential algorithms for such smart
parking systems. This study aims to assess the efficacy and
precision of the YOLO model in identifying open parking
spaces using aerial data. To do this, a large collection of aerial
images was gathered that included a variety of parking lots
and environmental factors. This dataset was used to train the
YOLO models, and known criteria were used to assess their
performance. The experiment's findings show that YOLO
version 8 surpasses version 7, showing higher accuracy and
efficiency in locating open parking spaces. Advancements in
the underlying architecture and optimization methods are
responsible for the improvements in the most recent version.
These results have important significance for the design of
intelligent parking systems since they provide light on the
capabilities of the most recent YOLO model for real-time
parking space recognition. This study emphasizes the potential
of YOLO version 8 as a useful tool for smart parking
applications and adds to the expanding body of knowledge in
the area of AI-based parking systems. The results of this study
may be used to improve the effectiveness and ease of parking
management in metropolitan areas through the design and
implementation of intelligent parking solutions. The adoption
of AI-powered smart parking systems shows promise in
tackling the rising parking difficulties experienced by car
owners throughout the world as private automobiles become
more and more preferred over public transit.
